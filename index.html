<article>
<p>Jazz originated in the early 20th century in New Orleans, Louisiana, from a blend of African, European, and Caribbean musical traditions. The African American community played a major role in its development, drawing from blues, ragtime, and brass band music, as well as African rhythms. Early jazz incorporated the use of syncopated rhythms and call-and-response patterns, which are deeply rooted in African musical traditions. </p>
<p>Additionally, the cultural diversity of New Orleans, with its blend of French, Spanish, African, and Creole influences, shaped jazz's distinct sound.</p>

<header><b>Improvisation is Key</b></header>
<article>
<p>Improvisation is one of the defining characteristics of jazz. Unlike most classical music, which follows strict written compositions, jazz musicians often improvise during performances. This allows them to express personal emotion, experiment with harmony, and engage in a dynamic, spontaneous interaction with other musicians.</p>
<p>The structure of jazz allows for flexibility, where musicians can deviate from the written melody or harmony, creating fresh variations on the spot. The art of improvisation is central to jazz's appeal and its ability to sound different each time it is performed.</p>
<code></code>
<ol>
  <li><b>Spontaneous Creation:</b> Jazz often involves impromptu solos and interactions during performances.</li>
  <li><b>Freedom:</b> Musicians can deviate from written melodies and explore personal expression.</li>
  <li><b>Personal Expression:</b> Improvisation allows musicians to convey emotions and experiences through music.</li>
  <li><b>Call-and-Response:</b> A musical conversation between instruments, common in African music and adapted in jazz.</li>
